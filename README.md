- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Felix, I have spent a year studying data analytics at university but decided to try and make it on my own.
-  I would love to collaborate on any project with any sort of data.
-  My current strength would mainly be Python, specifically Data Scraping and data gathering, with a little bit of SQL and Excel skills to match.
-  You can contact me at my email bennettfelixm@gmail.com
